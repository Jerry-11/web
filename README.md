# My portfolio website

**READ:**
I fixed the problem with the abouts etc. and optimized the css code but just pecause of your spacings between the projects and about it may look weird unless you fix that. I changed the . for the text Newsletter and i fixed your nav so it is centered. I don't want any payment but i would prefer that you keep the contributed by me text at the bottom. Or even add it on the page. As long as its only inside the README noone else can see it but if you want to give me more credit feel free to add my name in the footer or a credits section :) Have a nice day!
